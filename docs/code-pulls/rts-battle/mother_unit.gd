class_name MotherUnit extends UnitBase
## The Mother: a large, slow, high-HP command unit. It cannot harvest and cannot
## auto-attack — both fall out of the "mother" stats entry having no
## harvest_speed / attack_range (they default to 0, so harvest_at() no-ops and
## no attack Area2D is built). It is also never auto-targeted by enemies. It
## converts stored biomass into Level 1 Drones via spawn_unit() (SPI-1422), sending
## them to a rally point (SPI-1424) placed behind her when she is moving (SPI-1429).

const DroneScene := preload("res://scenes/units/drone.tscn")

## Distance from the Mother's center at which spawned Drones appear. 60 exceeds
## the Mother's body radius (32) plus a Drone's radius (16), so a spawned Drone
## never overlaps the Mother.
const SPAWN_RADIUS: float = 60.0
## Angular step between successive spawns so repeated Drones fan out around the
## Mother instead of stacking. Uses a plain counter (no RNG). (Bit-exact
## cross-platform determinism of the sin/cos placement is a separate, codebase-wide
## networking concern for M11/M12, not addressed here.)
const SPAWN_ANGLE_STEP: float = TAU / 8.0
## Offset from the Mother's center for the default rally when no explicit point is
## set: directly below, clear of the Mother's body (radius 32) plus a Drone's radius,
## so spawned Drones disperse instead of stacking on the Mother.
const DEFAULT_RALLY_OFFSET: Vector2 = Vector2(0, 96)
## Angular step between rear-fan slots while the Mother is moving. TAU / 10 (36°)
## keeps the widest slot (±2 steps) within ±72° of directly-behind — deliberately
## short of the ±90° hemisphere boundary, where the behind-ness dot product sits on
## zero and float error could tip it positive. It also spaces adjacent slots
## 2·SPAWN_RADIUS·sin(18°) ≈ 37px apart, clear of a Drone's 32px diameter.
const REAR_FAN_STEP: float = TAU / 10.0
## Rear-fan slot offsets in REAR_FAN_STEP units, alternating outward from
## directly-behind so successive spawns disperse without leaving the rear hemisphere.
const REAR_FAN_OFFSETS: Array[int] = [0, 1, -1, 2, -2]

## Biomass charged per Drone; loaded from data/upgrade_costs.json in _ready.
## Defaults to 0 so that if the data file cannot be read the Mother fails safe
## (spend_resources rejects a 0 cost) rather than charging a stale hardcoded value.

## Number of Drones spawned so far; drives the placement-ring angle.
var _spawn_count: int = 0
## Explicit rally point (world space); meaningful only when _has_rally is true.

## Whether the player has set an explicit rally (vs. the just-below-Mother default).
var _has_rally: bool = false
## World-space (top_level) visual for the rally point; a child so it frees with the Mother.
